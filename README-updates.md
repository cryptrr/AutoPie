## How to handle app version and packages version mismatch.

When the app versions are updated, AutoPie does not overwrite the /external_storage/AutoSec folder with the newest versions.

You will only get a notification that says newer packages are available.

This is to make sure that the user defined commands and user made edits to their commands are not overridden.

But to get new features, It is important to update the packages data that resides in /external_storage/AutoSec.

It is your responsibility to update it without losing your custom commands data.

You can get the latest packages archive from here
